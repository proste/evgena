\chapter{Experiments}
Experiments will be carried out for those scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
\item FGSM (white-box, target model)
\item FGSM (surrogate, different seed model)
\item FGSM (surrogate, teacher-student model)
\item FGSM (surrogate, specific binary teacher-student model)
\item EA (black-box, pure EA)
\item hybrid (surrogate, EA + pre-trained surrogate)
\item hybrid (surrogate, EA + on-demand-trained surrogate)
\end{itemize}

Each combination of following options will be tested:
\begin{itemize}
\item targeted vs non-targeted
\item single image vs multi-image vs generalization (unseen images)
\end{itemize}

Each experiment will be cross-validated using 14-fold cross-validation.
