\chapter{Underlying Theory}
In this chapter we will present theoretical background of various ??subjects (general word for methods, models, structures etc...)?? relevant to this ??writing??. We will cover various Artificial Intelligence paradigms with emphasis on Deep Learning for image classification and image generation, and Evolutionary Algorithms as a state space search method. Adversarial Example generation methods will be discussed as well.
TODO Overview - AI, ML, Optimization, Search - context and structure
