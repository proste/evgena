The effort to automate various processes in our lives has always been one of the key concepts of scientific research. The automation of mechanical work has already been solved to great extent by advances in engineering. On the contrary, automated processing of information has been solved just partially. Well defined tasks i.e., tasks with fully defined behaviour can be solved and the challenge lies just in effectivity of the solution. On the other hand, models solving tasks based on raw real word data, human level input and output or some degree of fuzziness are yet to be found or, if they exist, suffer from several shortcomings. One of those shortcomings is vulnerability to adversarial examples i.e., artificially created inputs misinterpreted by those models. In this thesis, we will cover the task of generating adversarial examples for the models used for classification in computer vision.

% The effort to automate various tasks in our lives has always been one of the most important concepts of scientific research. The inventions of various machines, from the water wheel through the steam engine to the internal combustion engine along with the electric engine, enabled mankind to automate mechanical work. In the same manner, people have always been seeking for ways to automate reasoning.

% The Syllogisms defined by Aristotle are often considered to be the first attempts to automate reasoning. Formation of propositional logic together with predicate logic laid foundations to formal logic. The evolution of formal logic and its parts, namely Boolean algebra originated theoretical computer science and, consequently, enabled the first digital computers to be built. Among other computer science fields, artificial intelligence was born. Various approaches towards automated reasoning emerged over the last few decades. While logical programming, ruled based systems and other ??formal?? paradigms proved successfull in solving multiple well defined tasks, they rendered useless when solving tasks with raw real world input or fuzzy data. SVM??. With soaring computational capabilities machine learning became state of the art.
